    <h1>Simple Q&A Wiki</h1>
<h2>Thinking & Overthinking</h2>
    
<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel overwhelmed by small things?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Small things can pile up when attention never fully resets.<br>
    Each item feels minor alone, but together they overload focus.<br>
    The weight comes from accumulation, not size.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my mind jump from one thought to another?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Jumping happens when no single thought feels settled.<br>
    Attention searches for stability but does not find it.<br>
    Movement replaces resolution.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel restless when I try to relax?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Relaxation removes structure the mind relies on.<br>
    Without direction, internal activity becomes noticeable.<br>
    Restlessness fills the gap.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel pressure without clear reasons?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Pressure can form from expectations that are not named.<br>
    The body reacts before the source is clear.<br>
    Tension remains without an obvious cause.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my focus disappear so easily?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Focus weakens when attention is split too often.<br>
    Switching leaves no time for depth to form.<br>
    Shallow engagement becomes the norm.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel uneasy even when things are fine?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Unease can persist after conditions improve.<br>
    Internal states do not update instantly.<br>
    The feeling lags behind reality.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I keep checking things repeatedly?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Rechecking is an attempt to gain certainty.<br>
    Assurance fades quickly, so the action repeats.<br>
    The loop continues without satisfaction.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my mind feel crowded?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Crowding happens when thoughts are stored without release.<br>
    New inputs arrive before old ones settle.<br>
    Space disappears from attention.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel tense without moving?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Tension can build from readiness without action.<br>
    The body prepares, but nothing follows.<br>
    The charge remains.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel disconnected from what I am doing?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Disconnection appears when attention is divided.<br>
    Actions continue while presence fades.<br>
    The gap creates distance.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my mind resist stopping?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Stopping removes familiar motion.<br>
    The mind prefers activity to uncertainty.<br>
    Continuation feels safer.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel urgency without a deadline?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Urgency can come from internal pressure, not time limits.<br>
    The body signals speed without context.<br>
    Pace increases without purpose.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel mentally full but unsatisfied?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Mental fullness can come from repetition, not completion.<br>
    Content accumulates without closure.<br>
    Satisfaction requires resolution.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my attention drift during simple tasks?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Simplicity offers few anchors for attention.<br>
    Without challenge or meaning, focus loosens.<br>
    Drift fills the space.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel alert but not effective?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Alertness reflects activation, not direction.<br>
    Energy is present without guidance.<br>
    Effectiveness requires alignment.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel mentally noisy?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Noise forms when multiple streams compete for attention.<br>
    No single signal stands out.<br>
    Clarity is drowned by overlap.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel stuck between options?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Being between options holds attention in suspension.<br>
    Commitment is delayed to avoid loss.<br>
    Movement pauses.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my mind feel unsettled?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Unsettled states arise when closure is missing.<br>
    Attention remains open-ended.<br>
    Stability has not returned.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel mentally drained after thinking?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Drain comes from sustained internal effort.<br>
    Processing consumes energy even without results.<br>
    Fatigue follows use, not outcome.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my mind keep running in the background?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Background activity continues when nothing signals completion.<br>
    Processes stay open by default.<br>
    The system never fully rests.
