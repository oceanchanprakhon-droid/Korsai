    <h1>Simple Q&A Wiki</h1>
<h2>Thinking & Overthinking</h2>
    
<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel overwhelmed by small things?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Small things can pile up when attention never fully resets.<br>
    Each item feels minor alone, but together they overload focus.<br>
    The weight comes from accumulation, not size.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my mind jump from one thought to another?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Jumping happens when no single thought feels settled.<br>
    Attention searches for stability but does not find it.<br>
    Movement replaces resolution.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel restless when I try to relax?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Relaxation removes structure the mind relies on.<br>
    Without direction, internal activity becomes noticeable.<br>
    Restlessness fills the gap.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel pressure without clear reasons?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Pressure can form from expectations that are not named.<br>
    The body reacts before the source is clear.<br>
    Tension remains without an obvious cause.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my focus disappear so easily?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Focus weakens when attention is split too often.<br>
    Switching leaves no time for depth to form.<br>
    Shallow engagement becomes the norm.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel uneasy even when things are fine?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Unease can persist after conditions improve.<br>
    Internal states do not update instantly.<br>
    The feeling lags behind reality.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I keep checking things repeatedly?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Rechecking is an attempt to gain certainty.<br>
    Assurance fades quickly, so the action repeats.<br>
    The loop continues without satisfaction.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my mind feel crowded?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Crowding happens when thoughts are stored without release.<br>
    New inputs arrive before old ones settle.<br>
    Space disappears from attention.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel tense without moving?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Tension can build from readiness without action.<br>
    The body prepares, but nothing follows.<br>
    The charge remains.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel disconnected from what I am doing?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Disconnection appears when attention is divided.<br>
    Actions continue while presence fades.<br>
    The gap creates distance.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my mind resist stopping?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Stopping removes familiar motion.<br>
    The mind prefers activity to uncertainty.<br>
    Continuation feels safer.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel urgency without a deadline?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Urgency can come from internal pressure, not time limits.<br>
    The body signals speed without context.<br>
    Pace increases without purpose.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel mentally full but unsatisfied?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Mental fullness can come from repetition, not completion.<br>
    Content accumulates without closure.<br>
    Satisfaction requires resolution.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my attention drift during simple tasks?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Simplicity offers few anchors for attention.<br>
    Without challenge or meaning, focus loosens.<br>
    Drift fills the space.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel alert but not effective?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Alertness reflects activation, not direction.<br>
    Energy is present without guidance.<br>
    Effectiveness requires alignment.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel mentally noisy?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Noise forms when multiple streams compete for attention.<br>
    No single signal stands out.<br>
    Clarity is drowned by overlap.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel stuck between options?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Being between options holds attention in suspension.<br>
    Commitment is delayed to avoid loss.<br>
    Movement pauses.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my mind feel unsettled?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Unsettled states arise when closure is missing.<br>
    Attention remains open-ended.<br>
    Stability has not returned.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do I feel mentally drained after thinking?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Drain comes from sustained internal effort.<br>
    Processing consumes energy even without results.<br>
    Fatigue follows use, not outcome.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my mind keep running in the background?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Background activity continues when nothing signals completion.<br>
    Processes stay open by default.<br>
    The system never fully rests.
  </div>
</div>
    
    <h2>Plant Care & Growing</h2>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my plant die even when I water it?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Plants do not die from lack of water alone.<br>
    Too much water blocks air from reaching the roots.<br>
    Without oxygen, roots slowly fail.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do plant leaves turn yellow?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Yellow leaves usually signal stress, not disease.<br>
    Water imbalance or weak light is often the cause.<br>
    The plant reduces effort by changing color.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does soil stay wet for too long?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Soil stays wet when air cannot escape.<br>
    Dense soil or poor drainage traps moisture.<br>
    The issue is often the container, not watering.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my plant stop growing?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Growth slows when conditions stay unchanged too long.<br>
    Limited space, light, or nutrients restrict expansion.<br>
    The plant pauses to conserve energy.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do leaves fall off suddenly?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Sudden leaf drop is a stress response.<br>
    Light, temperature, or watering changes can trigger it.<br>
    Dropping leaves helps the plant survive.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my plant look healthy but not grow?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    A plant can survive without active growth.<br>
    When conditions are just enough, maintenance replaces expansion.<br>
    Stability is chosen over growth.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do indoor plants grow slowly?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Indoor environments limit light and airflow.<br>
    Energy input is lower than outdoors.<br>
    Slow growth reflects limited resources.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my plant lean toward one side?</div>
  <div class="answer">

    Leaning is adaptation, not weakness.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my plant dry out so fast?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Water loss exceeds absorption.<br>
    Small pots, loose soil, or heat increase evaporation.<br>
    The plant cannot keep up.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do new leaves look smaller?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Limited energy affects leaf development.<br>
    Light or nutrients may be insufficient.<br>
    Smaller leaves reduce demand.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my plant wilt even with wet soil?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Wet soil can prevent roots from breathing.<br>
    Without oxygen, water uptake fails.<br>
    Wilting appears despite moisture.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do plant leaves curl?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Leaf curling reduces surface exposure.<br>
    It limits water loss or light stress.<br>
    Curling is protective.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my plant grow tall but weak?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Low light encourages stretching toward light.<br>
    Strength is sacrificed for height.<br>
    The plant prioritizes reach over stability.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do roots come out of the pot?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Roots search for space and resources.<br>
    A crowded pot limits expansion.<br>
    Escaping signals constraint.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my plant recover slowly?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Recovery depends on stored energy.<br>
    Stress depletes reserves.<br>
    Rebuilding takes time.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do leaves develop brown edges?</div>
  <div class="answer">

  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why do leaves grow far apart?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Spacing increases under low light.<br>
    The plant stretches to reach energy.<br>
    Density is sacrificed.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my plant look tired?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Sustained stress drains reserves.<br>
    Recovery lags behind demand.<br>
    Fatigue appears as stagnation.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does growth happen in bursts?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Growth follows energy accumulation.<br>
    When reserves fill, expansion occurs.<br>
    Bursts reflect readiness.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="question">Why does my plant stop responding?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Response slows when systems overload.<br>
